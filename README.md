# system
P.O.P.S. Flow state 

## Complete Pipeline Flow Architecture

**User Request to Scene Flow:**
1. **User selects AppDrop** → Shows in User Request stage
2. **Flow starts** → Data packet moves through Client → Agent/Worker → Automation
3. **Final presentation** → AppDrop appears as interactive iframe at Scene stage

## Key Features Implemented

**Full Pipeline Visualization:**
- 3D pipeline with visual data packet flow animation
- Each stage lights up as the AppDrop passes through
- Real-time status indicators showing flow progress

**Scene Viewer (Interactive iframe):**
- Fully interactive AppDrop iframe that users can scroll, input, and interact with
- Resizable and draggable window
- "Open in New Tab" button for external access
- Close/minimize controls
- Same-page interaction capabilities

**Flow Control Menu:**
- Complete task management system accessible via rocket ship button
- Shows all AppDrops available at each pipeline stage
- Tracks currently flowing AppDrops with visual indicators
- "Open AppDrops" section showing all active applications

**Scene Management:**
- Focus button to bring AppDrops to Scene viewer
- Close button to remove from pipeline
- New tab button for external window access
- Real-time tracking of all opened AppDrops

**Mobile-Optimized Controls:**
- Touch-friendly interface with haptic feedback
- Pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-rotate 3D pipeline
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Safe area support for notched devices

## User Experience Flow

1. **Launch**: User taps Apps button → selects AppDrop → automatically starts flow
2. **Processing**: Watch data packet travel through pipeline stages
3. **Presentation**: AppDrop appears in Scene viewer as interactive iframe
4. **Management**: Use Flow Control menu to manage multiple AppDrops
5. **Interaction**: Full interaction with AppDrop in same window or new tab

The system maintains complete visual continuity from selection through processing to final presentation, with the AppDrop physically moving through P.O.P.S. architecture before being delivered as a fully interactive interface element.
